title: "About"

I love learning new technologies, that's why I'm constantly expanding my skills with news from the world of broadly understood "dev". My interests range from DevOps, Kubernetes to Cloud Native.

In private I play the violin in a few bands and play with audio editors (mixing, mastering, i.e. everything related to sound processing). I have made a record of Egos, whose songs were played on Polish Radio 3, Radio Krakow and Radiofonia (listen).

The combination of these two passions resulted in an interesting initiative: help with the implementation of the biggest programming podcast in Poland - DevTalk.pl, by Maciej Aniserowicz.

In short, I would simply describe myself as an artist - programmer. This probably describes me best: I compose programs and compile songs.
